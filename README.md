# Chemical Demand : Analysis and Searching

This was meant as an entry level submission for the iNTUition v7.0, a hackathon organized by IEEE Student Branch NTU, in Feb 2021.

## Team Details
<b> Team Name </b> : HPHeroes

<b> Team Members </b> : Quok Zi Long Devon, Siddhant Pathak, Krystal, Wen Goh

## Problem Statement
<b> Chemical search engine </b>: Develop a web application which takes in a list of chemicals provided by a potential customer and searches for a match within HPâ€™s internal database. The input format of the list of chemicals can be in the form of pdf, excel, word, email, photo, or audio. The application should also build up a record of chemicals that customers have been requested, be able to visualise them so it is easy to understand which chemicals are checked for most, and alert the team when a new chemical is seen for the first time. Optional: implement a web search feature which finds related chemicals or compounds containing the searched chemical and tries to find its match in the database.

## Description
This is a web application that takes in a docx file and translates the chemical list into English. There is code partially working to scan the HP PDF document and getting the required row for chemical. We created a Python-based web application used to take up orders for chemicals from customers in Mandarin, convert them to English, and look for them in the HP Cloud Database.
